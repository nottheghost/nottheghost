  hi hello ty for scrolling down 
  heres my dni list and my reasons

  1. Weirdos, please don't talk to me if you act weird and intimate around me. i'm a minor and i don't appreciate this type of behavior. (i meant *those* types of weird, like perverts.)

2. Those who ship adult x child or like incest, pls dni cause that's disgusting. no comments.

3. Toxic selfshippers/yumeshippers. please don't interact if you act all dominant and protective and typa shit towards your favorite fictional yume. it's annoying me and i've saw some people acting like this to me.
(i know it's not a big deal and some of them are doing that cause their fav yume is probably their coping mechanism. but just pls dont act like that.)

5. Those who joke about sensitive topics are in between thin ice and dni. but a BIIG dni if you tell people to kill themselves just because of their own opinion. i've experienced this before.

6. 25+ please dni, no comment.

7. People who support pedophilia, zoophilia, or possibly anything/any weird ass fetishes, please dni because that's disgusting as fuck and i don't want to talk to someone that likes/ has a piss fetish.

8. Weird fans of any fandom are in thin ice because i get that it's their humor but that's still weird.

yay thank u for reading thats all haha
